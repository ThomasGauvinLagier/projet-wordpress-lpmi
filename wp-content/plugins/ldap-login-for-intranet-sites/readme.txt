[Active Directory Integration / LDAP Integration Login for Intranet Sites plugin](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-ldap-login-intranet-sites?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)   lets users sign in to WordPress using their LDAP or Active Directory credentials. It maps LDAP and Active Directory attributes to WordPress user fields, syncs profiles on login, and assigns roles based on directory groups or OUs.

This plugin supports:

* Microsoft Active Directory
* Azure Active Directory
* Sun Active Directory
* OpenLDAP Directory
* JumpCloud
* FreeIPA Directory
* Synology
* OpenDS and other LDAP directories.

* You can fetch LDAP OUs, map LDAP attributes, test LDAP and Active Directory authentication, and review LDAP authentication reports for failed login attempts.
* This plugin brings centralized LDAP and Active Directory-based authentication, improves access control, and keeps your WordPress user information consistent with your directory source.

**How the Plugin Works:**

When a user enters their details on the WordPress login page, the plugin sends an LDAP or Active Directory authentication request to your directory server. If the LDAP or AD credentials match, the user is logged in, and a WordPress account is created or updated.

During LDAP or Active Directory login, the plugin can:

* Read LDAP and AD attributes
* Map LDAP attributes to WordPress profile fields
* Assign WordPress roles based on LDAP or Active Directory groups and OUs
* Sync LDAP or AD user data on every login

You can enable LDAP secure connection (LDAPS) or Kerberos / NTLM for passwordless AD login on domain-joined machines. LDAP filters, multiple LDAP search bases, and backup LDAP servers can be configured when needed. LDAP authentication failures are logged for security review.

This ensures WordPress uses your LDAP or Active Directory server as the main source of truth for identity and login.

**Features of the AD Integration/ LDAP Integration Login for Intranet Sites Plugin**

The LDAP/Active Directory Login for Intranet sites plugin includes user management features as well, such as adding users from Active Directory or another LDAP Directory who are not registered in WordPress, WordPress role mapping, LDAP/Active Directory to WordPress attribute mapping, and more. We also provide additional add-ons that enhance the functionality of the basic plugin such as enabling [Kerberos/NTLM SSO Authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/kerberos-authentication-support?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration), importing users from Active Directory/LDAP Server to WordPress, creating users in Active Directory/LDAP server when created/registered in the WordPress site, sync users between the Active Directory/LDAP server and WordPress site, sync LDAP/Active Directory Profile Picture thumbnail attribute to WordPress user profile picture, AD integration with third-party plugins and more.

**What is Kerberos/NTLM Single Sign On (SSO)**

Effortlessly enable Single Sign-On (SSO) within your Active Directory-secured intranet using [Kerberos/NTLM authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/ntlm-kerberos-authentication-mechanism). Enjoy passwordless login for domain-joined machines and enhanced security through restricted external access. With cross-platform compatibility, [Kerberos authentication across Windows](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-setup-kerberos-windows-authentication) is also ensured. [Kerberos authentication can also be done access Ubuntu, CentOS, and RHEL](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-to-setup-kerberos-on-ubuntu-rhel-centos), protecting against unauthorized access and impersonation threats. You can also configure [Kerberos/NTLM SSO with Apache on Windows](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-to-setup-ntlm-sso-with-apache-on-windows).

**Benefits of Kerberos Authentication Protocol**

<strong>Secure Authentication</strong>: Strong cryptography ensures safe access to systems and resources.
<strong>Mutual Authentication</strong>: Verifies both client and server identities to prevent impersonation.
<strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Supports diverse operating systems and applications for broad SSO adoption.

= Use Cases = 

<strong>[Enable SSO for Multiple Active Directory Users on Domain-Joined Machines with Kerberos/NTLM](https://plugins.miniorange.com/sso-multiple-ldap-ad-using-kerberos-ntlm-protocol?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

Enable seamless login for employees who use domain-joined computers. When a user is already signed into their workstation with their LDAP or Active Directory account, the plugin (with the Kerberos / NTLM addon) can authenticate them automatically on WordPress without asking for a password. This gives your intranet a smooth, secure, and passwordless login flow.

<strong>[Enable MFA for External Access After LDAP Kerberos SSO](https://plugins.miniorange.com/kerberos-ntlm-sso-for-wordpress-sites?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

Inside the intranet, users can rely on SSO through LDAP or Active Directory. But when someone logs in from outside the network or over VPN, you can require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This protects sensitive content by verifying identity through both directory credentials and a second factor.

<strong>[Map LDAP/AD Groups and Attributes to WordPress User Profiles](https://plugins.miniorange.com/ldap-active-directory-group-based-authorization-in-wordpress?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

Use directory groups and user attributes to assign WordPress roles automatically. For example, members of an "HR" group can be mapped to an editor role, while others receive subscriber or custom roles. This reduces manual user management and ensures permissions stay aligned with your organizational structure.

<strong>[Automate LDAP/Active Directory Sync with WordPress for Seamless User Management](https://plugins.miniorange.com/user-directory-sync-between-active-directory-and-wordpress?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

Keep WordPress user accounts up to date by syncing them with LDAP or Active Directory schedules. This includes importing new users, updating profile details, syncing profile photos, and optionally enabling self-service password updates. This is useful for large teams where user details change often.

<strong>[Enable Multiple LDAP Directories Support for WordPress Authentication and Synchronization](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-user-authentication-from-ldap-active-directory?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

If your setup includes multiple directory domains or different LDAP servers, the plugin can authenticate users across all of them. It can try servers in sequence or route users based on their domain. This helps organizations with multi-forest, multi-tenant, or hybrid identity environments.

<strong>[LDAP/Active Directory Integration for WordPress Multisite Environments](https://plugins.miniorange.com/guide-to-setup-multisite-ldap-ad-plugin?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory%20Integration%20/%20LDAP%20Integration)</strong>

Manage LDAP or Active Directory authentication across an entire WordPress multisite network. Configure the directory connection once at the network level and apply it to selected subsites. Each site can inherit settings or define its own role mappings.
